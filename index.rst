What is Tangem Wallet?
----------------------

**Tangem Wallet** is a hardware wallet in the form of a credit card-sized NFC-enabled smart card. Unlike typical USB-based hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, Tangem uses **contactless technology** to manage and protect your crypto assets on the go.

It’s designed to be:

✅ **Secure** – Offline key generation with military-grade chip  
✅ **Portable** – No cables or screens, just tap with your phone  
✅ **Durable** – Waterproof, tamper-resistant, no battery needed  
✅ **Multi-asset Compatible** – Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, XRP, BNB, Polygon & more  
✅ **Non-custodial** – You control your keys, no third-party access  

Tangem provides a truly minimalist, yet powerful cold wallet experience.

----------------------------

1. **Download the Tangem App** – Available for iOS and Android  
2. **Activate Your Card** – Tap the card on your phone to begin setup
